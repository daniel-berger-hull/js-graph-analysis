   Started experiments on Dijkstras shortest path.  A test method been added to GraphModel.js 
   The code comes from the web site: 
            https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/ 
   Adaptation to my own Graph Model (using an adgency matrix) done, and results given are correct (print out on the console for now)
   
  To Do:
    * Try the Dijkstras algo on the main graph (which has less nodes than the Dijkstras example )

 To Do:
  * Should add the weigthed graph, instead of since connection node like it currently done.
  * Should add a NodeJS and add Jest tests...
