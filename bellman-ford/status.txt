  Started the conversion to Typescript, but the inclusion the the transpiled javascript is
  causing a lot of problems...
  
  
  
  Few work around in progress, and are very promising:
  
  1 - Need to have a tsconfig.json
  
    This appears to be good for now
      {
          "compilerOptions": {
            "allowJs": true,            
            "checkJs": true,
            "outDir": "dist",
            "sourceMap": true,
            "target": "ES6",
            "noImplicitAny": true,
            "noImplicitReturns": true,
            "strict": true
          }
  }
    
  2 - No more import {...} in the HTML file, or even any Javascript calls!
      Just put the <script src="yourScript.js"> and make all the calls in the .js file

  3 - Fix the 'ReferenceError: exports is not defined' error
  
  In the browser, an error happens at runtime, and the second line of the transpiled ts file
  is causing problem.
  
  the 'exports' variable may not be defined for some reason, add the following script tag:
  
  <script>var exports = {};</script> 
  <script src="index.js"></script>   // This one is your file you did transpile to javascript
