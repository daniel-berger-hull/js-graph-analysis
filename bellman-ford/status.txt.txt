  Added the code from the web site (more complete version)
     https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bellman-ford-algorithm-dp-23/
     
  And did copy the rendering classes of the previous tree project
  
  The node are visible after the rendering, but there is a difference with the edges,
  as we have weighted edges and directed (unlike tree, where it was not directed)
  Therefore, the  drawSegment and drawPath require changes to work
